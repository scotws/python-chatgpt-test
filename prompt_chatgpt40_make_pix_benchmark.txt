I would like you to help me create a Python 3 program to extract meta-data from
PNG image files, and then create a PDF file that lists that metadata together
with a thumbnail. 

The image files are in a folder. We will extract the metadata with the help of
an external program that is part of the ImageMagick suite of programs. The
command line instruction for this is: 

"""
identify -format '%[parameters]' ./<FILE NAME>
"""

The return value will look something like this:

"""
art by (Alphonse Mucha:1.3)
a cute female elf reading a book in a magic library
Negative prompt: nude, nsfw
Steps: 20, Sampler: DPM++ 2M Karras, CFG scale: 7, Seed: 3169807609, Size: 1024x1024, Model hash: 0f1b80cfe8, Model: dreamshaperXL10_alpha2Xl10, Version: v1.5.1

"""

We need to extract four things from this: 
        - the artist's name at the beginning, in this example "Alphonse Mucha";
        - the "prompt" at the beginning, in this example "a cute female elf reading a book in a magic library";
        - the "negative prompt" that follows, in this example "nude, nsfw"; 
        - the "model", in this example "dreamshaperXL10_alpha2Xl10".

Note that in many cases, there will be many pictures from the same artist. Also,
many pictures will have the same prompt. However, all pictures should have the
exact same negative prompt.

You will also need today's date in the ISO format.

When the program has extracted this information, we would like to output it in a
PDF in a table that has the following rough structure: 

"""
Stable Diffusion Benchmark <TODAY'S DATE>
Model: <MODEL NAME>

Artist    | <PROMPT 1> | <PROMPT 2> | <PROMPT 3> |
----------+------------+------------+------------+
          |            |            |            |
<NAME A>  |  Thumb A1  |  Thumb A2  |  Thumb A3  |
          |            |            |            |
----------+-------------------------+------------+
          |            |            |            |
<NAME B>  |  Thumb B1  |  Thumb B2  |  Thumb B3  |
          |            |            |            |
----------+------------+------------+------------+
          |            |            |            |
<NAME C>  |  Thumb C1  |  Thumb C2  |  Thumb C3  |
          |            |            |            |
----------+------------+------------+------------+

Negative prompt: <NEGATIVE PROMPT>
"""

In this example, there are pictures from three different artists with three
different prompts. 

The program will begin by asking the user for the location of the folder. If the
user does not give a location, use the current directory. 

Next, make sure we have read and write permission for the current folder. Abort
with an error message if this is not the case.

Next, see if the program "identify" is installed an executable. A board with an
error message if this is not the case.

Then extract the meta-data from all PNG files you can find in the folder as
described above. Ignore all other files. If there are no PNG files in the
folder, a board with an error message.

Finally, create the PDF as described above and save that to the folder with the
pictures.
