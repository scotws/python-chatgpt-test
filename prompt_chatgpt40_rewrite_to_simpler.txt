I would like to rewrite a Python 3 program that extracts meta-data from PNG
files and creates a HTML file with a table. I will provide you with the original
program. 

Currently, the program creates a table with the artists' names on one side for
the rows and the prompts for the columns. I would like to change this so we keep
the artists' names in the rows, but then we just put the thumbnails in the row
after that, without the prompts in the columns. 

The result in the HTML file should look something like this:

"""
Stable Diffusion Benchmark <CURRENT FOLDER>
Model: <MODEL NAME>

----------+------------+
          |            |
<NAME A>  |  Thumb A1  |
          |            |
----------+-------------------------+------------+
          |            |            |            |
<NAME B>  |  Thumb B1  |  Thumb B2  |  Thumb B3  |
          |            |            |            |
----------+------------+------------+------------+
          |            |            |
<NAME C>  |  Thumb C1  |  Thumb C2  |
          |            |            |
----------+------------+------------+
"""

We will, however, provide the following information:
- prompt
- negative prompt
- file name

The way we will do this is if the user clicks on one of the thumbnails, a window
will pop up. This will allow the user to mark and copy the information he needs. 

Are you ready for the original program?
